# End to end for `motty mcp-serve`, the MCP server that needs no window, against
# the loopback SSH fixture:
#
#   tools/e2e/run_agent_mcp_e2e.sh
#
# The window side (the headless build) saves two hosts, opens one to agents, trusts
# the fixture's key and lets agents run commands; the real `motty mcp-serve` is then
# driven over stdio by agent_mcp_e2e.py; the window side shows and clears what the
# agent did. Everything stays on this machine: the server listens on 127.0.0.1
# only, and the run has its own HOME and data directory, so neither the real saved
# hosts nor the system's secret store are touched (no password is saved, so the
# vault is never opened).
